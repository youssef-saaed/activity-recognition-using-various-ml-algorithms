# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Activity

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive comparative analysis of various machine learning models to classify activities based on a given dataset. The analysis follows a structured approach, including data exploration, model training, model evaluation, and results interpretation to identify the best performing model.

## Project Stages

### 1. Data Exploration
- **Loading the Dataset**: Imported the dataset and conducted an initial exploration to understand its structure.
- **Exploration**: Analyzed the distribution of data and visualized various columns.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated correlations between columns to understand relationships and data patterns.
- **Resampling**: Addressed the imbalance in the dataset by resampling techniques to ensure a balanced representation of classes.

### 2. Model Training
- **Models Trained**:
  - Neural Networks
  - Ridge Classifier
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Fine-tuning**: Utilized techniques such as k-fold cross-validation and grid search to optimize model parameters and improve performance.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- **Testing**: Evaluated the trained models on test samples.
- **Performance Metrics**: Generated confusion matrices and calculated accuracy scores to assess the performance of each model.

### 4. Results
